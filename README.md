This is part of a project of Alura called 7 Days of Code. During 7 consecutive days, each day a new simple project is proposed in the language/framework of choice. 
The goal of this project was develop a calculator using JavaScript. The original proposal was quite simple, taking 2 numbers and a operation from user with prompt and printin the result with alert. But I've studyied a little more and made a more real calculator. 

You can see the code and the final project on this link: https://codepen.io/anast-cia-canto/pen/xxYJMzM
